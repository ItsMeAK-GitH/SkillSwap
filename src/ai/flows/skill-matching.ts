Given a user's profile (skills to learn and skills to teach) and a list of other user profiles, identify potential skill swap partners.

For each user, determine which of the input user's skills to learn they can teach, and which of the input user's skills to teach they want to learn.
Also compute a relevance score for each match based on the number of shared skills and the overall complementarity of their skill sets.

User Skills to Learn: {{userSkillsToLearn}}
User Skills to Teach: {{userSkillsToTeach}}

All User Profiles: {{allUserProfiles}}

Return a JSON array of matched users, including their user ID, the skills they can teach the user, the skills they can learn from the user and a relevance score. Sort by relevanceScore in descending order.
